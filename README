Fitgen is a workout generator written in python running on Flask.

There is a lot not finished on here. I am intending on committing my work every
Sunday, just to make sure that I am actually getting stuff done. As such, there
may be a great deal of functionaility missing. When the site is presentable I
will issue "release" numbers.

This is mostly to help me learn the Flask web framework and SQLite3. I am
hoping to also add SQAlchemy to that list. See docs/flask/LICENSE for more
information regarding Flask's licensing. SQLite is Public Domain. Although
Fitgen is mostly for educational purposes and fun, I am licensing it under the
BSD license, more information regarding that in docs/LICENSE.
